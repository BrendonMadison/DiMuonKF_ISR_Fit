# DiMuonKF_ISR_Fit
Fit of the DiMuon sqrt(s) tail (lower energy tail) for the ILC 250 GeV e+e-. Uses Kuraev-Fadin's analytical ISR distribution to fit. Includes a 1 parameter fit, which only fits for mean beam energy sqrt(s). There is also a 3 parameter fit which changes fine structure constant, lepton mass and mean beam energy. See readme for results.
